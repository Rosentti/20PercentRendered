Hi, I'm Onni. I'm a 16-year-old software developer.
I'm currently studying at Riveria for Information and Communication technologies.
I mostly codes in:
- JavaScript and Typescript
- C#
However, I'm looking to get into Rust as well.

My "current" projects are:
- [Nitrox-20Percent](https://github.com/20PercentRendered/Nitrox)
- [creamlinux](https://github.com/20PercentRendered/creamlinux)
