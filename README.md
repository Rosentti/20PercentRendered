Hi, I'm Onni. I'm a 16-year-old software developer from Finland 🇫🇮.
I'm currently studying at Riveria for Information and Communication technologies.
I mostly code in:
- C#
- JavaScript and Typescript
However, I'm looking to get into Rust as well.

My "current" projects are:
- [Nitrox](https://github.com/SubnauticaNitrox/Nitrox)
- [creamlinux](https://github.com/20PercentRendered/creamlinux)
